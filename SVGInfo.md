            First off, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector image format that is an open standard developed by the W3C since 1999. They are defined in XML text files and can be created and edited with any plain text editor or drawing software. The benefits of SVG images over rastor images is that they are infinitly scalable, meaning that you can resize it anyway you want without it becoming pixelated.
